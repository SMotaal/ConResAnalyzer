The analysis involves systematic assessment of the visibility thresholds for the resolution, tone and contrast extremes to determine the limitations of the printing system.\r\n\r\nNumeric and visual representations are produced to document the findings in the final analysis report. Systems are characterized for quality control purposes and ranked for comparisons against ideal baselines related relative to the response the human visual system.\r\n\r\n#### Core Functions\r\n\r\nThe goal is to create an automated software that requires minimal operator intervention. This eliminates the redundant tasks which are handled systematically. To accomplish this, modules are developed for digital image segmentation, Fourier image analysis, and search algorithms.\r\n\r\nJava is used to develop the final solution. MatLab is also used extensively in the research and development phase in order to refine the algorithms used.\r\n\r\n#### Contact and Inquires\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in learning more about this project, ConRes, or the software aspects Please feel free to contact Saleh Abdel Motaal (@daflair).","tagline":"ConResAnalyzer with ConResLab","google":""}
